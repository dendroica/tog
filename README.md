# Tautog stock assessment update: NJ-NY bight

My goal was to code every step of the update, from inputs through outputs. In other words, I aimed to start each script with "canonical" inputs distributed by ASMFC and code every step through generating output files. An exception to this is the use of files for the NJ Ocean Trawl survey from in-house; they are files generated annually within NJDEP with the entire time series for a given species.
